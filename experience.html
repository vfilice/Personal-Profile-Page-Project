        <p>Prior to pursuing a career in web development, I worked as a horticulturist/landscaper for many years. I began as a lowly apprentice and worked and studied my way up to become a foreman.</p>
        <p>Key themes I learnt during that progression, the hard way most of the time, was to: stay humble, maintain a growth mindset, and recognize effort is the key to mastery.</p>
        <p>I feel my previous path is very analogous to my current path and I am infinitely grateful to have those experiences to draw invaluable lessons from.</p>
